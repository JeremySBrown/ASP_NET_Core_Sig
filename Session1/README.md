To start, you can use DotNet Core, which does not require Visual Studio to be installed.

Go to http://dot.net/ and click on "Download", then click on ".Net Core". You can then click on the .NET Core 1.0.3 SDK - Installer, either the Windows x86 or Windows x64 link, depending on whether you are running Windows 32-bit or Windows 64-bit. Once downloaded, click to run the installer. This is all you will require.

If you want to use Visual Studio, scoll down and click on the "Windows" step by step instructions. This will prompt you to install Visual Studio 2015, then install Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, then download and install an extension for Visual Studio. That is a multiple hour process, I recommend just downloading the SDK installer and installing it.

This session assumes you have read the corresponding chapters of the book and have some familiarity with C# and ASP.Net MVC development. If not, Microsoft Virtual Academy has a number of free courses with videos and associated sample code:
